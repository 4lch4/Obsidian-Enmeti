## Obsidian Enmeti

Obsidian Enmeti is an Obsidian plugin, based on my VS Code extension, whose sole purpose is to make it easier to insert links and images to your files.

## Name

Enmeti means "Insert" in Esperanto, I like the way it sounds, it had a fitting meaning, so the project is called Enmeti.
